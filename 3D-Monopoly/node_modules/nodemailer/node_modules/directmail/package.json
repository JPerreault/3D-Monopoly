  "readme": "# DirectMail\n\nSendmail alternative to send e-mails directly to recipients without a relaying service.\n\n## Usage\n\nRequire *directmail* object\n\n    var directmail = require(\"directmail\");\n\nAnd push a message to the outgoing queue\n\n    directmail({\n        from: \"sender@example.com\",\n        recipients: [\"receiver1@example.com\", \"receiver2@example.com\"],\n        message: \"Subject: test\\r\\n\\r\\nHello world!\",\n        debug: false\n    });\n\nWhere\n\n  * **from** (string) is the e-mail address of the sender\n  * **recipients** (array) is an array of recipient e-mails. Put all `to`, `cc` and `bcc` addresses here.\n  * **message** (string|buffer) is the RFC2822 message to be sent\n  * **debug** (boolean) if set to true, all data about queue processing is printed to console\n\n*Directmail* is very inefficient as it queues all e-mails to be sent into memory. Additionally, if a message is not yet sent and the process is closed, all data about queued messages are lost. Thus *directmail* is only suitable for low throughput systems, like password remainders and such, where the message can be processed immediatelly. *Directmail* is not suitable for spamming.\n\nWhile being not 100% reliable, *directmail* can still handle sending errors, graylisting and such. If a message can not be sent, it is requeued and retried later.\n\n## License\n\n**MIT**\n\n",
