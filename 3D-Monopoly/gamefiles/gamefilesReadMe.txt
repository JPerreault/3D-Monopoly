The css folder contains a css file with the CSS for the cards, money, chance and
community chest cards. It also has the CSS for the debug controls and the game controls
in the top right corner. Because the graphics for our game were in 3D, a lot of the 
visual elements of our game are not done in CSS, so this file may be more sparse than
other group's CSS files.

The img folder contains the images we used for the 2D graphics. The textures folder has 
the images we used for the 3D graphics. This includes both the images applied as textures 
to the 3D shapes and the STL files. STL files are 3D files that can be imported into three.js, 
which is the 3D graphics engine we used. This allowed us to import the hotels, houses
and monopoly pieces rather than having to create those custom pieces ourselves, which
is something that requires extensive knowledge of 3D modeling software.

The js file contains the javascript files for the game, which I will describe in further detail
inside that folder.
